# Guide: Making a Gaming Home Theater PC with Kodi and Lutris

**This guide will explain how to set up [Kodi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodi_\(software\)) and [Lutris](https://lutris.net/) on a [Home Theater PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_theater_PC). The goal is to create a fast, light-weight media and gaming system for the living room in the same vein as [SteamOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SteamOS), but with Kodi as the interface.**

The guide itself is a separate file named `GUIDE.md` which you can find [HERE](./GUIDE.md).

I have earlier created another guide titled [Minimal Ubuntu 16.04 with Kodi, Steam & EmulationStation](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=282593) where I tried to achieve something similar. However, I never felt that the approach described in that guide was satisfactory. It relied on launching Steam and/or [EmulationStation](http://www.emulationstation.org/) as separate applications outside of Kodi for playing games.

Using Lutris, however, it is possible to create a much more coherent media center and gaming experience.

> Lutris is an open source gaming platform for GNU/Linux. It allows you to gather and manage (install, configure and launch) all your games acquired from any source, in a single interface.

Using Lutris, all your games will be displayed natively in Kodi. No external applications will be are launched, except the games you want to play!

The guide is written with the Linux beginner in mind. Therefore, I have added a lot of links to external resources where you can read up on the different topics covered in the guide. If anything seems unclear, you need some help, or notice a mistake in the guide, please let me know using one of the channels below.

There is a small amount of flickering in the video due to FFmpeg not handling Kodi well.
